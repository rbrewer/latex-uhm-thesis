This archive contains everything necessary to prepare a University of Hawaii
thesis or dissertation with a recent LaTeX2e environment like TeX Live. For
information on how do download LaTeX distributions, go to <http://www.tug.org/>

This class is hosted at Google Code:

<http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/>

For assistance with this package, please visit the associated Google Group:

<http://groups.google.com/group/latex-uhm-thesis-discuss>

The following files should be placed in your personal or departmental LaTeX
style directory:

uhthesis.cls	Document class file

For example, on MacTeX 2008 you could create the directory
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/uhthesis and copy all four files
above into that directory to allow all users on the computer access to the
class. If you only need the class file to be accessible by yourself, you
could create ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/uhthesis (all the directories after
Library will have to be created) and then copy the four files in. A similar
procedure should work for other TeX Live 2008 distributions.

An example of how to use the style with extensive comments is provided in the
example/ subdirectory. The following files make up this style. Start with
"uhtest.tex".

uhtest.tex
uhtest-abstract.tex
uhtest-acknowledgements.tex
uhtest-appendix.tex
uhtest-body.tex
uhtest-dedication.tex
uhtest-figure.eps
uhtest.bib

Good luck! You can report bugs or wonderful new features you have implemented
to the Google Group discussed above.
